# cactus-encrypt
cactus encrypt is a simple command line encryption program I wrote in my free time because I was bored. 
It is written entirely in python 3 and uses the simple but flexable cactus encrypt encryption algorithm I created along side it.
it is very posible to make a gui wrapper for the program, but I probable won't make one because i'm lazy.
cactus encrypt is compiled using the excellent nuitka compiler. 

v1.5 update:
this update adds bug fixes, adds two more characters to the default character set, finally reorders the default character set to a sacrambled version, splits the encryption engine and 
user interface into seperate files adding room for custom and possibly grpahical user interfaces in the future and 
increasing readability and maintainabilty, adds support for loading and saving keys as text files, encrypting and 
decrypting text files, and loading character sets from text files. 

WARNING!
cactus encrypt uses a nonstandard character set and will either refuse to work or completely break if an unsupported character is used. a list of supported characters is avalible on the information screen.


#todo: rewrite README.md
