# cactus-encrypt
cactus encrypt is a simple command line encryption program I wrote in my free time because I was bored. 
It is written entirely in python 3 and uses the simple but flexable cactus encrypt encryption algorithm I created along side it.
it is very posible to make a gui wrapper for the program, but I probable won't make one because i'm lazy.
cactus encrypt is compiled using the excellent nuitka compiler. 

WARNING!
cactus encrypt uses a nonstandard character set and will either refuse to work or completely break if an unsupported character is used. here is a complete list if all supported characters: {qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm ;1234567890-=!#$%^&*()_+QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKL:ZXCBVNM<>?.,[]'"\~|}. Please note that curly braces are not supported characters and are only used to denote the start and end of the list. this list can also be found in the program's built in information screen.
