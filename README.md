# cactus-encrypt
cactus encrypt is a simple command line encryption program I wrote in my free time because I was bored. It implements a flexible rotor based encryption algorithm with interchangeable character sets and rotors I call the cactus cipher. Rotors can be generated on the fly, and encryption keys can use any number of rotors. It is written entirely in python 3 and is compiled using the excellent Nuitka compiler. it is very possible to make a gui wrapper for the program, (the modular design makes this quite easy) but I probably won't make one because i'm lazy.
