# cactus-encrypt
cactus encrypt is a simple command line encryption program I wrote in my free time because I was bored. 
It is written entirely in python 3 and uses the simple but flexable cactus encrypt encryption algorithm I created along side it.
it is very posible to make a gui wrapper for the program, but i probable won't make it because i'm lazy.
