rewrite decrpytion so that it can use the same index style logic as encryption to increase speed. this requires swapping the indexes for the key information and vice versa. this will probably best be done by adding a second decoding wiring list to the rotor class.


modify decrypt function in rotor to use decode wiring
prototype:

#put in constructor

decodeWiring=[0]*len(wiring)

for i in range(len(wiring)):
    decodeWiring[wiring[i]]=i
