Welcome to cactus encrypt version 2.0!




as its creator and sole dev, I thank you for using my little passion project.
cactus encrypt is entirely free, so if you payed for it, you have been scammed and should demand your money back.
cactus encrypt has no warranties and anyone using the program does so at their own risk.




now on to the details:
cactus encrypt is a flexible encryption program written entirely in python 3. version 2.0 bring many new features to the table, including support for encrypting text files, a built in text filter function, and interchangeable character sets. since this program can get a bit cryptic, this guide is here to give you a hand. using the program is fairly simple, just follow the onscreen instructions, and give input when prompted. it is designed to be mostly idiot proof and to recover from potential crashes, even in the worst case scenarios, but not everything can be tested for.



general warnings:
keys and character sets are very tightly linked in cactus encrypt, to the point of where character sets can also be considered part of the key. if you don't use correctly matching character sets, encryption and decryption will most likely fail. additionally, text encrypted with one one pair can only be decrypted with the same pair. if you try to use a different one, it won't work. also, due to complex internal encoding reasons, character sets can only have ONE occurrence of the any character in them. having more than one will always cause decryption to fail, and as such the program is specifically written to check for this. the sanitization features that remove characters not found in the currently loaded key from text and text file are very basic features and while they try their best, they are not guaranteed to work perfectly and will often cause text formatting problems and occasionally make text unreadable, depending on the key and text combination. additionally, when replacement mode is selected, the program will look through a list of potential characters to use for replacement (specifically this list: {" _-|*+.$?Xx"}), and pick the best replacement present, but if none are present in the key, invalid characters will only be removed, and no replacement will occur.



the structure of the program folder:
the program is distributed as a zip file containing a folder. in this folder you will find several files and the cactus encrypt executable. do not delete or modify any of these file unless explicitly stated that you can. messing with these files will likely prevent the program from running correctly or at all.



features:
cactus encrypt can perform 17 operations. it can decrypt and encrypt text entered through the terminal, it can encrypt and decrypt text files, it can generate, new encryption keys, it can save and load these keys to text files and the terminal, it can sanitize both text and text files, either removing or replacing invalid characters, and it can load, save, and scramble character sets.



advanced features:
by overwriting default_charset.txt and default_key.txt, you can replace the default key and character set with your own, and have it automatically load it at start up, so long as the new files have the exact same names.




common errors:
"io error: file to read could not be opened." 
this error occurs when the program is unable to find or open the specified file. this is usually caused by misspelling the file's name, not including the file extension, which is necessary, or that the file could not be accessed for one reason or another, often because another program is using it or cactus encrypt does not have the system permissions necessary to access it. this can usually be fixed by closing any other programs accessing the file, verifying that cactus encrypt has the needed system permissions, and verifying the file name given to the program is correct and has the proper extension. if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"io error: file to write could not be opened/created."
this error occurs when the program is not able to open or find the specified file. this is usually caused by misspelling the file's name, not including the file extension, which is necessary, \or that the file could not be accessed for one reason or another, often because another program is using it, the file is write protected, or cactus encrypt does not have the system permissions necessary to access it. this can usually be fixed by closing any other programs accessing the file, verifying that cactus encrypt has the needed system permissions, verifying the target file is not write protected, and verifying the file name given to the program is correct and has the proper extension. if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"io error: file could not be written to."
this is a slightly uncommon error that is caused by the currently open file could not be written to for one reason or another. this can have several causes, usually involving file system shenanigans, specific timing, and write protection. my best advice is to verify that the file is not write protected and that another program is not attempting to access it and try again. if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"input error: given complexity value is invalid."
this one is an easy fix. this error occurs when the complexity value for key generation given to the program is not a positive integer (a whole number greater than zero ex. 5). to fix it, just try again with a positive integer.


"input error: key could not be parsed."
this error occurs when the program fails to process a key given to it into its internal representation. this is usually caused by improperly entering the key or tampering with the key. my advice is to examine the key for errors (good luck with that), and try loading the key again. if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"critical error: character set could not be parsed."
this error occurs when the program fails to process a character set given to it into its internal representation. this is usually caused by invalid/improperly formatted character sets, and character sets containing invalid characters. my advice is to examine the character set for errors and try again. cactus encrypt is pretty picky with how it likes its keys and character sets, so this error is often easily fixable. I recommend never messing with any working character sets to begin with. if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"character error: the character "{example} in the given text is not present in the currently load character set."
this issue is simple. cactus encrypt isn't magic, no matter how much i wish it was. in order to encrypt text, all the characters in the text must also be in the currently loaded character set. if it finds one that isn't, it gives this error. fixing this is pretty easy. either remove all instances of that character from your text, or add it to the character set and generate a new encryption key. if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"input error: multiple occurrences of the character {example} were found in the character set. please remove all duplicates of the character then try again." this is a simple issue with a simple fix. unfortunately, due to the nature of the cactus encrypt algorithm, character sets can only have one instance of a character per set. to prevent the problems this causes, the program checks for this and produces this error if detected. the fix is simple. follow the instructions in the error and remove any extra instances of the character in the set then try again. if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"input error: character set key mismatch, character set and key do not have the same number of characters."
this error is simple. with cactus encrypt, encryption keys and character sets are closely tied together. if you mismatch them, neither will work correctly. in this case, the encryption key you are attempting to load was designed for a character set with a different number of characters. to fix this, just us a properly matched character set and encryption key pair. if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"character error: the character {example} in the given file is not present in the currently load character set."
this issue is simple. cactus encrypt isn't magic, no matter how much i wish it was. in order to encrypt a file, all the characters in the file must also be in the currently loaded character set. if it finds one that isn't, it gives this error. fixing this is pretty easy. either remove all instances of that character from your file, or add it to the character set and generate a new encryption key. if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"warning, help file could not be loaded!" and "uh, oh! the help file couldn't be loaded!"
these errors mean that the file you are reading right now could not be found or loaded by the program. this usually happens if it is open in another program, has had its name changed, cactus encrypt doesn't have the right file permissions, or has been removed from the cactus encrypt folder. to fix it, just make sure all of the above are rectified the try again.  if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"notice: no encryption key loaded"
this error has two possible causes. the first is an intended side effect of loading a new character set, where the key is cleared for safety. the second is caused by the program not being able to load the default key on startup.  this usually happens if it is open in another program, has had its name changed, cactus encrypt doesn't have the right file permissions, or has been removed from the cactus encrypt folder. to fix it, just make sure all of the above are rectified the try again. you can also just load or generate a new key. if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


"notice: no character set loaded"
this error means that the default character set could not be loaded on startup.  this usually happens if it is open in another program, has had its name changed, cactus encrypt doesn't have the right file permissions, or has been removed from the cactus encrypt folder. to fix it, just make sure all of the above are rectified the try again.  if all else fails, restarting the program and/or your computer may help.


help! my output is nothing but garble!:
if this occurs with no other errors, that means the the problem is a PEBKAC error. this can have a myriad of causes, but usually boils down to a single or combination of these errors: 1. the text to encrypt or decrypt was incorrectly entered. 2. the character set was incorrectly entered. 3. the wrong encryption key is being used. 4. the wrong character set is being used. 5. you didn't listen to the warning about character sets not being able to have multiples of the same character in them, and somehow got around the software protections for this. addressing these usually fixes things. 



uncommon errors:
there are several uncommon errors that are very difficult to trigger. if you encounter any, my best advice is to just try again and/or restart the program and/or your computer.



if you encounter any errors not listed here or have questions, don't hesitate to message me!


have fun with cactus encrypt!
