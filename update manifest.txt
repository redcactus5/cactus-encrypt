possible upgrade of cactus encrypt that uses text files for the saving and loading of keys, can optionally encrypt and decrypt text files and output the results to a text file, lets you name said files and load enter the file name to load, and a new default character set that is a scrambled version of the current one, with added curly brackets. Also possibly a system to save and load character sets from text files, though not as part of the key, due to technical limitations. (There is a possible way to fix this though, by using a character from the extended utf-8 character set instead of pipes in the key, which would allow for the character set to be in the key, though this would lower security, so itâ€™s not recommended) 
make it attempt to load a default character set and key at startup
